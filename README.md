Automatically converts the active SD V1.5 model in to an inpainting model when starting an inpainting gen.

Please note:
- This will download a 1.68 GB model when activated for the first time.
- This only supports checkpoints based on SD 1.5. I'm not planning to add support for other versions of SD.
